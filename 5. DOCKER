INTRO, ANALYSIS, ARCHITECTURE, SETUP & SOME BASIC COMMANDS

MONOLITHIC: SINGLE APP -- > SINGLE SERVER -- > SINGLE DB
MICRO SERVICES: SINGLE APP -- > MULTIPLE SERVERS -- > MULTIPLE DB

containerization: Process of packing application with its dependencies.
EX: PUBG 
BEFORE CONTAINARIZATION: [APP=PLAYSTORE MAPS=INTERNET]
AFTER CONTAINARIZATION: [APP(MAPS) = PLAYSTORE]

CAKE=BAKERY & KINFE=STORE
SWIGGY= CAKE & KNIFE 


LIMITATIONS:
1. DEPENDCY
2. SCALE
3. SLOW DEVELOPMENT
4. TESTING 


WHY MICRO SERVICES :
CLOSTLY -- > SOLUTION

SERVERS = CONTAINERS

CONTAINERS:
it is used to create, run and deploy application.
conatiainers are advance than servers.
these are light weighted components.

IMAGE:
it will have os which req to run our container.
os -- > pkgs -- > deploy

DOCKER:
its a tool used to create containers.
its a free and opensoure platfrom to create containers.
its platfrom independent.
docker runs on any os but natively supports linux distributions.
it is used to containerize the application.
language: GO LANG
Year: 2013
Who: Solomen Hykes and Sebastian Phal
befor docker user faced lot of issues, after docker users are not facing the issues.


DOCKER COMPONENTS:
DOCKER CLIENT: it interacts with us (command -- > execute -- > output)
DOCKER HOST: Where we install docker (Ec2, Laptop, Vm)
DOCKER DAEMON: manages all docker components (Conatiners, Images, Volume)
DOCKER REGISTRY: it manages all the docker images.

INSTALLATION:
yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
docker version

COMMANDS:
docker images		: to show list of images
docker pull amazonlinux	: to get image amazonlinux from dockerhub
docker run -it --name cont1 amazonlinux : to create container

ls
yum install git maven tree httpd -y
check the version
touch file{1..10}

ctrl p q		: to exit from container
docker search ubuntu	: to search images
docker ps -a		: to list all containers
docker ps 		: to list runnings containers
docker stop cont1	: to stop the container
docker start cont1	: to start the container
docker attach cont1	: to go inside the container
docker inspect cont1	: to get the complete info container
