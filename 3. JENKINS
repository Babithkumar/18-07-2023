INTRO, SETUP, CI

JENKINS:
its a ci/cd tool.

CI: Continous Integration = Continous build + Continous test
what: old code + new code
Tools : Git, maven, jenkins

Before CI:
time waste
manual work
regular mistakes

After CI:
time save
automated work
bugs find more quickly
efficency

CD: Continous Delivery/Continous Deployment

Continous Delivery : Manual deployment of app to Prod
Continous Deployment : Automation deployment of app to Prod

Deployment: Process of installing application to App servers
Ex: Tomcat, Nginx, WebSpeher, Glassfish, IIS

ENV:
DEV	: Developers
QA	: Testers
UAT	: Client

PRE-PROD/NON-PROD : DEV, QA, UAT

PROD	: Users

LIVE: PROD

PIPELINE:
Step by step execution of a process.
series of events interlinked with each other.

code -- > compile -- > test -- > Artifact -- > Deployment
raw meat-- > wash -- >ingredients -- > cook -- > Biryani

JENKINS:
its a free and opensource ci tool.
its written on java language.
its platform independet.
it will automate the CI, CD.
it will automate the entire SDLC.
it will have plugins to work and to automate.

HISTORY:
who: koshuke kawagachi
year: 2004
programming: java
depedency: java-11
port: 8080

Note: 1.5 years ago jenkins use java-1.8.0

sun mcirosystem -- > Hudson -- > paid
oracle -- > jenkins -- > free


SETUP: CREATE EC2 INSTANCE WITH ALL TRAFFIC

#STEP-1: INSTALLING GIT JAVA-1.8.0 MAVEN 
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven -y

#STEP-2: GETTING THE REPO (jenkins.io --> download -- > redhat)
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD JAVA11 AND JENKINS
amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

CONNECTION:
public-ip-server:8080
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword


HOW TO DO CI:
JOB: if we want to work on jenkin we need to create job.

=====================================================================================

DAY-02: 20-09-2023

VARIABLES, ADMIN ACTIVITIES

CREATING A JOB: 
new item -- > name -- > free style -- > ok -- > Build Steps -- > execute shell
we can run linux coomands on execute shell

VARIABLES:
1. USER DEFINED VARS: these variables will be declared by user.

A. LOCAL VARS: these variables will work inside job

name=sunil
loc=hyderabad
echo "hai all my name is $name, $name is from $loc, $name is teaching devops"

B. GLOBAL VARS: these variables will work outside of job also

Dashboard
Manage Jenkins
System
Global properties
Environment variables
ADD -- > name: raham loc: gudivada

2. JENKINS ENV VARIABLES: these variables will be given by jenkins.
user cant define jenkins variables.

JENKINS ADMIN ACTIVITES:
vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service 
line 67 (8080=8069)
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart jenkins.service

RESTORING DELETED JOBS:
Dashboard -- > Manage Jenkins -- >Plugins -- > Available plugins -- > Job Configuration History -- > install -- > 
delete a job and -- > Job Configuration History 

PASSWORDLESS LOGIN:
vim /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml (true=false)
systemctl restart jenkins.service


DAY-03: cronjobv, pollscm, webhoook, throttle build, troubelhooting

NOTE: WHEN WE STOP AND START THE SERVER BY DEFAULT ALL SERVICES WILL BE ON STOPPED STATE

CRON JOBS: used to schedule the works in jenkins.
Ex: build shedule, deployment, db backups
CRON SYNTAX: * * * * *

*	: minutes
*	: hours
*	: date
*	: month
*	: day (sun=0, mon=1)


11:15 am 22 sept 2023

https://crontab-generator.org/

LIMITATION:
IT WONT CHECK THE CODE

POLLSCM: it will trigger the build when code is changed in given time.
create a ci job -- > Poll SCM -- > * * * * * -- > save
change the code in and check.

LIMITATIONS:
1. TIME WASTE ( 11 AM -- > 9 AM )
2. 5 TIMES CODE IS CHANGED ( 5TH TIME BUILD)


WEBHOOK: IT WILL TRIGGER THE BUILD IMMEDIETLY WHEN WE CHANGE CODE
IT WILL GIVE BUILD FOR EVERY TIME WE CHNAGE CODE.
CODE: 4:10 BUILD: 4:10
CODE: 4:20 BUILD: 4:20

THROTTLE BUILD: it will restrtic the number of builds per interval.
create a ci job -- > Throttle build -- > builds: 3 time period: hours -- > save
make a build and test


NOTE: chkconfig jenkins on
above command will make jenkins service automatically restart itself when sevrver is stopped and started
