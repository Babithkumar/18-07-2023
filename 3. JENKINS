UAT	: Client

PRE-PROD/NON-PROD : DEV, QA, UAT

PROD	: Users

LIVE: PROD

PIPELINE:
Step by step execution of a process.
series of events interlinked with each other.

amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

CONNECTION:
